# Statamarkdown
This is a collection of R functions that extends knitr's capability 
for using Stata as a language engine.  They have no use if you do not 
also have Stata installed.

You can install these as an R package:
```
devtools::install_github("Hemken/Statamarkdown")
```
Then you can check with
```
library(Statamarkdown)
help(package="Statamarkdown")
```
If the package was installed, you should see an R Help page.

Additional documentation can be found at https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~hemken/Stataworkshops/Statamarkdown/stata-and-r-markdown.html .
