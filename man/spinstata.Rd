}

\details{
This function takes a Stata file containing special mark up in
it's comments, and converts it into knitr's "spin" format. 
This is in turn sent to \code{knitr::spin}, and converted to
Markdown and HTML (or one of several other formats).

Special Markup:
\itemize{
\item{\code{"/*' "} - Begin document text, ends with \code{"'*/"}}
\item{\code{"/*+ "} - Begin chunk header, ends with \code{"+*/"}}
\item{\code{"/*R "} - Begin a chunk of R code, ends with \code{"R*/"}}
\item{\code{"*/* "} - Dropped from document, ends with
\code{"*/*"}}
}

}
\value{
The path to the output file.

If given text instead of a file, returns the compiled document as a
character string.

This is a special Stata script which can be used to generate a report.
You can write normal text in command-style comments.

First we specify a path for Stata and set up some options.

library(Statamarkdown)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(engine.path=list(stata=find_stata()), comment=NA)
