# Statamarkdown
This is a collection of R functions that extends knitr's capability 
for using Stata as a language engine.  They have no use if you do not 
also have Stata installed.

You can install these as an R package:
```
devtools::install_github("Hemken/Statamarkdown")
```
Then you can check with
```
library(Statamarkdown)
help(package="Statamarkdown")
```
If the package was installed, you should see an R Help page..

If you would like to contribute to this project, please "fork" it on Github and then clone it back to your computer.  Make your changes and enhancements, push them back to your Github repository, then initiate a "pull" request.
